I've been playing a game of human and mouse recently. A couple of weeks ago,
as I was walking into the kitchen, I spotted a mouse darting under the fridge.
My first thought was to create an elaborate security camera system to find out
where they go in the house.


# The setup
I've been meaning to put together a camera system that makes it easy to observe
plants & animals etc.

## parts list
- raspberry pi zero W
- NoIR camera module
- 16GB SD card
- 2.5A 5V power supply
- infrared (IR) spotlight + 12V supply
  - possibly from [Jaycar?](https://www.jaycar.com.au/infrared-security-spotlight/p/QC3652)
- official raspberry pi zero case
- generic flexible camera tripod
- blu-tack, rubber bands, sticky tape, cardboard

## how to use it
You can find the various scripts I used in [this repo](https://github.com/uozuAho/pi_stuff).

Each evening, I set up the camera in the spot I wanted to monitor. I used
[termux](https://termux.com/) to log into the raspberry pi and start the video
stream, and [VLC for Android](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-android.html)
to watch the stream. This made it easy to position the camera. Once I was happy
with the camera & IR spotlight position, I started recording video to my network
drive.

Each morning, I scanned the recorded videos for motion using
[dvr-scan](https://dvr-scan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


# What I found

- on kitchen bench, eww
